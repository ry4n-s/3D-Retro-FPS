# 3D-Retro-FPS
A game made in Python using Pygame to replicate 90's FPS's.

Uses the raycasting technique to trace the rays from the player's eye and find the closest object blocking the path; this allows for the game to appear 3D. Also uses the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm for enemy path-finding.
